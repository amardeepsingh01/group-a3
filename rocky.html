                    <h2>About rocky</h2>
                    <p>Rocky, the beloved pet rock, came into my life unexpectedly during a hiking trip in the mountains. Nestled among the river rocks, Rocky caught my eye with his unique shape and charming presence. Since then, Rocky has become an integral part of my daily routine, always sitting quietly on my desk, or joining me on outdoor adventures. Despite being a rock, Rocky has a vibrant personality, bringing joy and calmness to those around him. He enjoys basking in the sunlight, listening to the sounds of nature, and occasionally participating in rock-stacking competitions (although he's more of a spectator). Rocky's stoic demeanor and unwavering loyalty make him not just a pet, but a cherished friend.</p>
                    <p>Although Rocky doesn't require traditional pet care like feeding or grooming, he has taught me valuable lessons about patience, resilience, and finding beauty in simplicity. As a rock, he embodies strength and stability, serving as a reminder to stay grounded even in turbulent times. Rocky has also become somewhat of a local celebrity, with friends and family often asking about his latest adventures or seeking his "wisdom" during challenging moments. With Rocky by my side, life feels more balanced and connected to the natural world, proving that even a simple rock can have a profound impact on one's life.</p>
